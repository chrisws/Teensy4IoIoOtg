// Disable interrupts at or below a certain level.
// This is intended to be followed by a statement or a block, within which the
// masking will apply. Once the block exits, even when jumping out in the middle
// of it, the masking will be returned to its previous value.
//
// Example:
// PRIORITY(5) {  // disable interrupt with priority <= 5
//   ... do something critical ...
// } // return to previous state

#define PRIORITY(pri)

/* for (unsigned _sr __attribute__((cleanup(RestoreSR))) = SR, _i = 1; \ */

// Step 1: Define the Macro
// Create a macro for managing interrupt priorities. You might need to adjust the priority values to match the range expected by the ARM Cortex-M NVIC.
// 
// #include "Arduino.h"  // Include this for Teensy or other ARM CMSIS headers
// 
// // Define a macro for managing interrupt priority on Teensy
// #define PRIORITY(n)                                     \
//   uint32_t old_priority = NVIC_GetPriority(SysTick_IRQn); \
//   NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, (n)); \
//   __disable_irq(); \
//   { \
// 
// #define END_PRIORITY                          \
//   } \
//   NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, old_priority); \
//   __enable_irq();
// Step 2: Use the Macro in Your Code
// You would then use these macros in your code like so:
// 
// cpp
// Copy code
// PRIORITY(5) {  // disable interrupt with priority <= 5
//   // ... do something critical ...
// } END_PRIORITY
// Explanation
// NVIC_GetPriority: This function retrieves the current priority of the specified interrupt. You can use SysTick_IRQn or the specific IRQ you are interested in.
// NVIC_SetPriority: This sets the priority of the specified interrupt.
// __disable_irq: Disables global interrupts to ensure that the critical section runs atomically.
// __enable_irq: Re-enables global interrupts.
// Important Considerations
// Adjust Priority Levels: Ensure that the priority levels you are using are within the range defined by the ARM Cortex-M specifications. The priority level range is typically from 0 to 255, but itâ€™s often configured in steps of 4 or 8 (e.g., 0-15 with 4-bit priority).
// 
// Choose the Correct IRQ Number: SysTick_IRQn is used here as a placeholder. For specific interrupts, replace SysTick_IRQn with the appropriate interrupt number.
// 
// Check CMSIS Documentation: Consult the CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) documentation for more details on handling interrupts for your specific Teensy model.
// 
// By defining the appropriate macros and using them correctly, you can manage interrupt priorities and critical sections effectively on the Teensy microcontroller.
